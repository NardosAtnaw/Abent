          <p>
            For small and medium-sized businesses as well as start-ups, hiring a dedicated in-house lawyer to
            oversee and manage all of the legal matters they encounter is not always practical or cost-effective,
            unlike large corporations and businesses. As a result, many small and medium-sized businesses seek
            the assistance of outside legal counsel.
