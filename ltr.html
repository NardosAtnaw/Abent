            <strong>
              Are you looking for a long-term partnership that will allow you to receive our services on a
              consistent basis? 
            </strong>
            Through a retainership agreement, we are happy to provide our services to
            businesses on an ongoing basis. There are two options for engaging us through a retainer agreement.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Option A: A fixed monthly fee for a set period of time: 
            </strong>
            <br>

         When you opt up for this service, our attorney will be available for a given amount of time each
month for a monthly fixed fee. This removes the need to search for a lawyer every time you need to
work on a certain legal issue or problem. It also gives you a reason to keep us involved in your
business rather than waiting until a legal issue becomes too big to ignore
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Additionally, by choosing the fixed monthly fee retainer service, your firm will pay a lower charge
for any time we spent outside of your plan or for any additional legal work not covered by your fixed
monthly fee retainer agreement
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that this option is only available to a limited number of firms in order to give the best
possible availability and service to those clients.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Option B: A monthly retainer fee combined with a set fee for future services:
            </strong>
            <br>
            For as little as $100 per month, our office will enter into a Retainer Agreement with you, defining the
terms and conditions of our future engagement whenever you require our legal services. If you do not
use our services, you only pay a small fixed monthly fee to retain our office. Whenever your firm
requires any of our services, you will be charged the fee and subject to the terms and conditions
outlined in our Retainer Agreement.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            If you select this option, you will have the assurance that whenever you require any of our services,
we will provide them in accordance with the terms and conditions outlined in our Retainer Agreement.
This gives you peace of mind about the cost of any future legal services you may require
          </p>
