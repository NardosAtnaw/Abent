          <p>
            For our individual clients, we provide legal advice and consultation services on personal, civil, and
family matters, including divorce, child custody and maintenance, as well as cases of will and
inheritance.
          </p>

         <br>
          <p>
            Our legal advice and consultation services aim to provide our clients with comprehensive legal
            information and advice that allows them to adequately protect their rights, assets, and family's
            interests in Ethiopia. This service is provided by our attorney, who has extensive experience in
            providing legal advice and consultation on a wide range of legal issues and questions.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            At AbnetLaw, we also draft and review documents and contracts for individual clients pertaining to
their contractual and legal needs. We also assist them in negotiating different kinds of contracts to
ensure that they are protected and get better terms. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In many cases, a consultation is all that is required. In other cases, we offer our clients our other
            serviceâ€”a civil litigation service. Our civil litigation practice encompasses a wide range of civil
            lawsuits, including all types of contract disputes, torts, as well as family disputes varying from divorce
            to marital property division. We also represent clients in estate and inheritance litigation.
